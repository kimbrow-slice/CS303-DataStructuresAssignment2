## Overview

LinkedList - The purpose of this program was to create a single linked list class which contains the data members head, tail, and num_items. This program enables the user to interact with a CLI that allows them complete operations such as adding, removing, and finding elements within the list, as well functions to allow for input validation and stream insertion. 

StackProject - The goal for this program was to implement a stack of integers using a vector with push and pop operations. I created a basic UI that allows the user create a stack object, check for an empty stack, insert integers onto the stack, remove elements from the stack, find the top of the stack, and to find the average value of the elements currently in the stack. 

## Setup

1. Open Visual Studio Community. (Tested in Visual Studio Community 2022 only)
